# WSN-Simulation-Attempt
My first project on .NET Windows Form. Tried to create a simple visual simulation of Wireless Sensor Network. Program allows to create nodes and sybil nodes with random coordinates. Nodes can be visually connected with their neighbours by drawing a line between nodes. There is no real connections between nodes.
